# NodeJS-JWT-Auth-MongoDB with example of the AO on nexploit.app

For API calls check "APICalls.txt", and for AO check "Example of the AO on nexploit.txt"

First run "npm install", then "node server.js" and please make sure that you have NodeJS installed and MongoDB locally!

For security researchers / BB hunters: ALL credentials/secrets are just mock examples, that will be created if you execute particular API call locally on your PC / your database (mongodb). Nothing to report here to me or anyone :)
